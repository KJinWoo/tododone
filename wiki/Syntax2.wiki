WikiSyntax is identified and linked automatically

Wikipage is not identified, so if you have a page named [Wikipage] you
need to link it explicitly.

If the WikiSyntax page is actually about reindeers, you can provide a
description, so that people know you're actually linking to a page on
[WikiSyntax reindeer flotillas].

If you want to metion !WikiSyntax without it being autolinked, use an
exclamation mark to prevent linking.
